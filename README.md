This is my (Joseph Haaga) personal site source code. It's the StartBootstrap Freelancer theme with some CSS animations and my personal contact info/urls.

- Working on JS to pull latest Wordpress posts

TO DO:
- Set up A/B testing w/ Google Analytics
	- test Contact Me before/after Wordpress section
	- test number of items
	- test color schemes
